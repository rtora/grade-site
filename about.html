            <h2>This site is for research purposes only</h2>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This website contains grades data from various University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) campuses. The data encompasses academic records from the years 2000 to 2023.</p>
            <h2>How to Use this Site</h2>
            <p>You can select as many or as few of the filters as you like. Suggestions will appear beneath your filter box, and you can click on a suggestion to autofill it. Once you are done, click the submit button.</p>
            <p>Note: Not all filters work with every school. University, Year, Quarter/Semester, Subject, and Catalog Number should work for all schools. Also, filters search based on an exact match, so it is recommended to use the autocomplete suggestions.</p>

            <h2>Missing Data</h2>
            <h3>Why isn't data from my school included?</h3>
            <p>Requests were made for data from every UC and CSU. However, some institutions did not respond, while others requested payment, which was not feasible due to budget constraints. If you wish to fund data acquisition from your university, please contact me. Below is a list of schools from which data was not obtained, including reasons and requested payments:</p>
