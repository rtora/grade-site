            <h1>Grades Website</h1>
            <h2>This site is for research purposes only</h2>
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This repository contains grades data from various University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) campuses. The data encompasses academic records from the years 2000 to 2023. Each row in the dataset represents a class offered in a specific academic term, along with the count of each type of grade awarded for that class.</p>

            <h2>Data Updates</h2>
            <h3>How often will the data be updated?</h3>
            <p>The data will be updated annually at the beginning of each year.</p>

            <h2>Missing Data</h2>
            <h3>Why isn't data from my school included?</h3>
            <p>Requests were made for data from every UC and CSU. However, some institutions did not respond, while others requested payment, which was not feasible due to budget constraints. If you wish to fund data acquisition from your university, please contact me. Below is a list of schools from which data was not obtained, including reasons and requested payments:</p>
